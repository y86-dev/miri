//! Implementation of a data-race detector using Lamport Timestamps / Vector-clocks
//! based on the Dynamic Race Detection for C++:
//! https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/homepages/papers/pdfs/2017/POPL.pdf
//! which does not report false-positives when fences are used, and gives better
//! accuracy in presence of read-modify-write operations.
//!
//! The implementation contains modifications to correctly model the changes to the memory model in C++20
//! regarding the weakening of release sequences: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0982r1.html.
//! Relaxed stores now unconditionally block all currently active release sequences and so per-thread tracking of release
//! sequences is not needed.
//!
//! The implementation also models races with memory allocation and deallocation via treating allocation and
//! deallocation as a type of write internally for detecting data-races.
//!
//! This does not explore weak memory orders and so can still miss data-races
//! but should not report false-positives
//!
//! Data-race definition from(https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/memory_model#Threads_and_data_races):
//! a data race occurs between two memory accesses if they are on different threads, at least one operation
//! is non-atomic, at least one operation is a write and neither access happens-before the other. Read the link
//! for full definition.
//!
//! This re-uses vector indexes for threads that are known to be unable to report data-races, this is valid
//! because it only re-uses vector indexes once all currently-active (not-terminated) threads have an internal
//! vector clock that happens-after the join operation of the candidate thread. Threads that have not been joined
//! on are not considered. Since the thread's vector clock will only increase and a data-race implies that
//! there is some index x where clock[x] > thread_clock, when this is true clock[candidate-idx] > thread_clock
//! can never hold and hence a data-race can never be reported in that vector index again.
//! This means that the thread-index can be safely re-used, starting on the next timestamp for the newly created
//! thread.
//!
//! The sequentially consistent ordering corresponds to the ordering that the threads
//! are currently scheduled, this means that the data-race detector has no additional
//! logic for sequentially consistent accesses at the moment since they are indistinguishable
//! from acquire/release operations. If weak memory orderings are explored then this
//! may need to change or be updated accordingly.
//!
//! Per the C++ spec for the memory model a sequentially consistent operation:
//!   "A load operation with this memory order performs an acquire operation,
//!    a store performs a release operation, and read-modify-write performs
//!    both an acquire operation and a release operation, plus a single total
//!    order exists in which all threads observe all modifications in the same
//!    order (see Sequentially-consistent ordering below) "
//! So in the absence of weak memory effects a seq-cst load & a seq-cst store is identical
//! to an acquire load and a release store given the global sequentially consistent order
//! of the schedule.
//!
//! The timestamps used in the data-race detector assign each sequence of non-atomic operations
//! followed by a single atomic or concurrent operation a single timestamp.
//! Write, Read, Write, ThreadJoin will be represented by a single timestamp value on a thread.
//! This is because extra increment operations between the operations in the sequence are not
//! required for accurate reporting of data-race values.
//!
//! As per the paper a threads timestamp is only incremented after a release operation is performed
//! so some atomic operations that only perform acquires do not increment the timestamp. Due to shared
//! code some atomic operations may increment the timestamp when not necessary but this has no effect
//! on the data-race detection code.
//!
//! FIXME:
//! currently we have our own local copy of the currently active thread index and names, this is due
//! in part to the inability to access the current location of threads.active_thread inside the AllocExtra
//! read, write and deallocate functions and should be cleaned up in the future.
